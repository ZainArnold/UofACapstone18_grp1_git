Example Summary
---------------
Example includes the EasyLink API and uses it to configure the RF driver to RX
packets. This project should be run in conjunction with the rfEasyLinkTx
project.

For more information on the EasyLink API and usage refer to
http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/SimpleLink-EasyLink

Peripherals Exercised
---------------------
* `Board_PIN_LED1` - Indicates an abort which is expected to happen 300 ms after RX has been scheduled
* `Board_PIN_LED2` - Indicates that a packet has been received
`Board_PIN_LED1` & `Board_PIN_LED2` indicate an error
* `Board_GPTIMER0A` - Used to timeout the receive operation if it runs over 
300ms in the no-RTOS asynchronous implementation


Resources & Jumper Settings
---------------------------
> If you're using an IDE (such as CCS or IAR), please refer to Board.html in your project
directory for resources used and board-specific jumper settings. Otherwise, you can find
Board.html in the directory &lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/source/ti/boards/&lt;BOARD&gt;.

Example Usage
-------------
Run the example. Board_PIN_LED2 will toggle indicating a packet has been received.
Board_PIN_LED1 will toggle indicating an abort, which is expected to happen if a
packet is not received within 300 ms of the RX being scheduled. Board_PIN_LED1 and
Board_PIN_LED2 indicates an error (not expected to happen under normal conditions,
but may occur if there is some interference).

After running this application you should start the rfEasyLinkTx on a second
board to transmit packets. Until the rfEasyLinkTx has been started the
receiver will be continuously RX.

Application Design Details
--------------------------
This example shows how to use the EasyLink API to access the RF drive, set the
frequency and receive packets. The board will blink LED2 when a packet has been
received. When a second board is running rfEasyLinkTx example then the expected
behavior is that Board_PIN_LED2 will blink every 100 ms 10 times, the TX will then
wait for 300 ms before transmitting the next packets and if RFEASYLINKRX_ASYNC
is defined (as it is by default) then this will cause the rfEasyLinkRx example
to timeout and exercise the EasyLink_abort API. When an RX has been aborted
Board_PIN_LED1 should toggle. The rfEasyLinkTx board will then transmit another
burst of packets and Board_PIN_LED2 should blink another 10 times and the cycle
should repeat.

If RFEASYLINKRX_ADDR_FILTER is defined (as it is by default) then the RX
address filter will be enabled for address 0xaa. This will cause the
rfEasyLinkRx to only accept packets with a destination address of 0xaa, which
the rfEasyLinkTx example transmits. When using the rfEasyLinkTx example there
will be no difference in behavior when defining/undefining
RFEASYLINKRX_ADDR_FILTER as the rfEasyLinkTx example will use a destination
address of 0xaa. However, if transmitting from another source like SmartRF
Studio and not using an address of 0xaa, then defining RFEASYLINKRX_ADDR_FILTER
will result in packets not being received.

A single task, "rfEasyLinkRxFnx", configures the RF driver through the EasyLink
API and receives messages.

EasyLink API
-------------------------
### Overview
The EasyLink API should be used in application code. The EasyLink API is
intended to abstract the RF Driver in order to give a simple API for
customers to use as is or extend to suit their application[Use Cases]
(@ref USE_CASES).

### General Behavior
Before using the EasyLink API:

  - The EasyLink Layer is initialized by calling EasyLink_init(). This
    initializes and opens the RF driver and configures a modulation scheme
    passed to EasyLink_init.
  - The RX and TX can operate independently of each other.

The following is true for receive operation:

  - RX is enabled by calling EasyLink_receive() or EasyLink_receiveAsync()
  - Entering RX can be immediate or scheduled
  - EasyLink_receive() is blocking and EasyLink_receiveAsync() is non-blocking
  - The EasyLink API does not queue messages so calling another API function
    while in EasyLink_receiveAsync() will return EasyLink_Status_Busy_Error
  - An Async operation can be cancelled with EasyLink_abort()

The following apply for transmit operation:

  - TX is enabled by calling EasyLink_transmit(), EasyLink_transmitAsync()
    or EasyLink_transmitCCAAsync()
  - TX can be immediate or scheduled
  - EasyLink_transmit() is blocking and EasyLink_transmitAsync(), 
    EasyLink_transmitCCAAsync() are non-blocking
  - EasyLink_transmit() for a scheduled command, or if TX cannot start
  - The EasyLink API does not queue messages so calling another API function
    while in either EasyLink_transmitAsync() or EasyLink_transmitCCAAsync() 
    will return EasyLink_Status_Busy_Error
  - An Async operation can be cancelled with EasyLink_abort()

### Error Handling
The EasyLink API will return EasyLink_Status containing success or error
  code. The EasyLink_Status codes are:

   - EasyLink_Status_Success
   - EasyLink_Status_Config_Error
   - EasyLink_Status_Param_Error
   - EasyLink_Status_Mem_Error
   - EasyLink_Status_Cmd_Error
   - EasyLink_Status_Tx_Error
   - EasyLink_Status_Rx_Error
   - EasyLink_Status_Rx_Timeout
   - EasyLink_Status_Busy_Error
   - EasyLink_Status_Aborted

### Power Management
The power management framework will try to put the device into the most
power efficient mode whenever possible. Please see the technical reference
manual for further details on each power mode.

The EasyLink Layer uses the power management offered by the RF driver Refer to the RF
Driver documentation for more details.

### No-RTOS Implementation
The No-RTOS implementation uses a general purpose timer to timeout the receive
operation, for the asynchronous case, if it exceeds 300ms.

### Frame Structure
The EasyLink implements a basic header for transmitting and receiving data. This header supports
addressing for a star or point-to-point network with acknowledgements.

Packet structure:
